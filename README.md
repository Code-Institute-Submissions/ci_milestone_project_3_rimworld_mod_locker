# Rimworld Mod Locker
by Donal O'Farrell

Milestone Project 3: Data Centric Development - Code Institute 

RimWorld is an indie space colony management game developed by Ludeon Studios, a Montreal-based game studio founded by Tynan Sylvester.

[Rimworld Mod Locker](https://rimworld-mod-locker.herokuapp.com/) aims to create a site where users can login, upload new mods with its name, description and a link to where it can be downloaded. It is purposely designed to be a desktop focused app with mobile responsiveness at a minimum.

## UX
 
#### Project Goals
Rimworld is a game that has a massive mod (user modifications) community where the vast majority of players tend to run their games with an average of 50 - 200 mods. These are, for the most part, supplied for free via Valve's gaming app, [Steam.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/294100/workshop/)

The main problem faced by members of the Rimworld community is the browsing capacity of Steam is quite limited with options being 'Most Popular', 'Most Subscribed' and 'Most Recent'. Outside of those options, your search is limited to direct name search and a tag system but both are found lacking due to inaccurate, questionable results. 

Rimworld Mod Locker aims to solve this problem by supplying the very sought after ability to browse mods by what category they fall under. This is an extremely common question often asked among Rimworld community social media groups e.g. "I'm looking for new races to add to the game. Anyone have a list of good mods to add?"
 
#### Developer Goals
The developer's goal was to make a data-centric website for portfolio purposes that showed off a range of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and an understanding of how databases work.

The developer is also a frequent player of the game Rimworld and a major user of mods for the game. This project is to be a way of saying thank you to the community who spend so much time and effort to create these mods for free. The fact that content can be generated by other users too means the developer themselves could also use the site to discover new and exciting mods.
 
#### User Goals
The user's goal is to have a quick and convenient way of finding new mods for Rimworld by category. As a mod maker, this would also be a strong way of marketing a newly created mod.
 
#### User Stories
- As a player of Rimworld, I want to find new mods of extra factions to add to the game.
- As a player of Rimworld, I want to browse new medical mods to add to my game.
- As a player of Rimworld, I want to help my favourite mod get more attention.
- As a mod maker of Rimworld, I want somewhere to show off my newly created mod.
 
#### Design Choices
 Rimworld Mod Locker was designed to be desktop focused, as opposed to mobile focused, as the time when most users would be looking for new mods would be when they are running the game itself (which requires a desktop). 

**Font** 
- Calibri was chosen as an excellent option for a safe, universally readable sans-serif font. This is also the font used within the game itself so the player base would make an association with it.

**Icons** 
- The icons were all chosen for their obvious, commonly used meanings.

**Colours** 
- The colours chosen are based on colours and themes used within the game itself plus to help make the site look like an extension of the [official Rimworld website](https://rimworldgame.com/) though with noticeable references that it is fan-made and not directly affiliated. 
- The darker elements of the game with its blacks and greys  help add to the atmosphere of bleakness that a disaster in the game can invoke.
- The shade of red used for the delete buttons is actually directly used with raiders in the game so that colour would be associated with destruction for regular players.
- Likewise the shade of gold chosen for some of the 'positive' buttons such as create is associated with positive things happening and rewards.
- The off white colour chosen was taken from the game logo and is often used in post apocalyptic worlds for old tech.

**Styling** 
  - Colours were kept as consistent as possible with also taking in visibility vs the background into consideration. 
  - Where visibility was semi-problematic, a more visible lighter hover effect was added so these buttons would be more visible.
  - Changing the font from black to white was considered for several buttons but was decided against as looked too off-theme.
  - The hyperlink text decoration on the links of each mod was kept on purpose as it highlighted that it was a link plus the contrast of the hyperlink blue against the grey background drop and white font looked very 'old world tech'.

**Backgrounds:** 
- The background planet was chosen to have a consistent image among all pages and its subtle fade to black at the bottom goes unnoticed if the page length gets considerably long.
- This image also paired up with the parent, official site.

**Audio Files:** 
- No audio files were deemed necessary for this project and would just slow downloading speeds while being a distraction.

## Features
 
#### Existing Features
- **Time Counter:** Gives the user a visual representation of how long they have left to finish the game. Also helps add an element of suspense.
- **Music/SFX Toggles:** Allows the user to turn off audio elements they might not enjoy. These toggle choices stay consistent through a victory, game over or reset to avoid user frustration.
- **Reset Button:** Allows the user to start over again on a new game rather than having to wait for a game over or victory. Can allow the user to try to get a better score without getting frustrated waiting. This also recalls music and SFX toggle choices and difficulty.
- **Flip Counter:** Gives the user a visual representation of how many flips they have taken so far in the game. This is also given as a score in the victory screen to encourage replayability to achieve a lower amount of flips.
- **Hardmode:** Allows the user to try the game at a harder level where they only have half the amount of time to try finish the game. This is visually noted on the victory screen to add to the accomplishment.
- **Contact Form:** This allows users to get directly in touch with the developer with an easy to use form requesting name, email and their project request. This is sent directly to the developer.
- **Github Link:** The developer's name is fully visible and a direct link to their Github page is available. This will open a new tab rather than accidently leave the game.
 
#### Features Left to Implement
- For the game to pause when the contact form window is open.
- When changing difficulties, audio toggles need to stay consistent.
 
## Technologies Used

#### Testers
Special thanks to:
- Aria Keane (6)
- Amy Buckley (28)
- Jo O'Farrell (60+)
 
The wide age gap between the testers gave the developer a better understanding of certain difficulties and expectations e.g. original background music was too intense for the 6 year old.
 
#### Feature Testing
- **Time Counter:** Accurately counts down time in both normal and hard modes. Successfully triggers Game Over when it hits zero.
- **Music/SFX Toggles:** Both toggles fully work on desktop and mobile and toggle position remains as selected when reset.
- **Reset Button:** Rest button works on both desktop and mobile devices. Fully returns cards face down, in new positions and resets timer and flip count.
- **Flip Counter:** Accurately reflects the number of flips clicked. Does not count up when illegal clicks occur. Resets on game over, victory and new game.
- **Hardmode:** Successfully triggers hardmode which resets the game with only 50 seconds to win as opposed to the 100 seconds on normal mode. This also successfully triggers a statement declaring the user won on hardmode if they get a victory screen while it's toggled.
- **Contact Form:** Form opens when click on desktop and mobile and closes when top right x is clicked, anywhere outside the box is clicked. Email sends to the developer with the name, email address and message when 'Send Request' is clicked.
- **Github Link:** Successfully links to Github page on both desktop and mobile device.
 
#### Difficulties Encountered
- The biggest difficulty faced in this project was trying to bring in a fully functional hardmode without having to rewrite the entire code. It was found that trying to create a separate hardmode function broke the code all over the place. This was finally solved with the use of an internal function and the previous hardmodeToggle function was removed.
 
- The option of hardmode adding more cards instead of a reduced time was highly considered but it was decided that this would not function on mobile devices due to cards being too small so it was dropped for a time challenge instead. The ability to keep it accessible for mobile devices was considered worth it.
 
- After getting all the music and sfx toggles fully functional, a new difficulty arose when the reset button started a total new game and put the toggle back to their starting positions which is on by default. This was fully worked through in the end and is fully functional as intended.
 
- The above sound issue arose again with the introduction of the normal and hard mode buttons. This resets the sound regardless of toggle positions. This can only be fixed by a complete refactoring of the code and will be remedied for future releases.
 
- Displaying the final flip count in the victory screen proved to be more difficult than originally thought but was solved by making a clone function of flips called score.
 
- Keeping the card sizes viable for mobile took a lot of playing around with media queries but this was achieved.
 
- A sound issue encountered with ios devices was that audio no longer plays automatically without a user interaction triggering in. This was fine with the background, victory and SFX sounds as all require an action to start but it means the gameover storm audio doesn't trigger as it is caused by time running out rather than a direct player interaction. A work around could have been made with an audio play button on the gameover screen but was decided this would look too out of place and was dropped.
 
- Have observed the custom cursor not applying across the button of the screen when on desktop. This has remained the case as the issue was never solved.
